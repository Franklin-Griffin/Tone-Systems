# Tone-Systems

Typically in music, we use a 12-tone system, which means there are 12 tones in an octave. The frequency ratio of an interval is the same as any other appearance of that interval. For example, C and E are 4 half-steps apart, and so are F and A. The frequency ratio of both these pairs is 4:5. This concept is called "equal temperament." This webpage allows you to hear how other equal temperament notes and scales sound, using middle C (261.63 hz) as a reference.
